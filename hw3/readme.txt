There are 2 files in this folder (excluding the README.txt):
* q7q8.py (which calculates the Ein and Eout for gradient and stochastic gradient descent)
* graph.py (which plots the results)

All of these files require the following environments:
* Python 3 with numpy, matplotlib, json, time and multiprocessing modules (the latter two being built-in).
* To run these files, simply type "python XXX.py" in a terminal.

Note that the resulting graphs themselves are on the pdf file submitted on gradescope, though you can get the same graphs by running the files in this folder.

q7q8.py
=========
This file computes the Ein and Eout for the gradient and stochastic gradient descent algorithms. 
It generates 4 arrays, which are the following:
- Ein of w vector generated by gradient descent (eta = 0.01), as a function of t (from 0 to 2000)
- Ein of w vector generated by stochastic gradient descent (eta = 0.001), as a function of t (from 0 to 2000)
- Eout of w vector generated by gradient descent (eta = 0.01), as a function of t (from 0 to 2000)
- Eout of w vector generated by stochastic gradient descent  (eta = 0.001), as a function of t (from 0 to 2000)
These four arrays are then saved to results.json when run.
It also prints the execution time (though this is not related to the homework).

graph.py
=========
This file is meant to run after q7q8.py generates results.json. 
It reads the aforementioned results.json and creates two graphs, one for Ein (for Problem 7) and one for Eout (for Problem 8).
These graphs are the same as the ones shown on the pdf.
